Computer Science Bsc Undergraduate Final Year Project: TALES

TALES (Technology and Learning for Early Stages) was created over a few month as part of my final year project at the University of Sussex.

My main objective was to teach programming concepts to the Early Years/KS1. You can read the full [dissertation here](http://melenie.co.uk/TALES.pdf). 

This was later accepted as a Work In Progress at the [PPIG 2016 - 27th Annual Workshop](http://www.ppig.org/workshops/ppig-2016-27th-annual-workshop)
